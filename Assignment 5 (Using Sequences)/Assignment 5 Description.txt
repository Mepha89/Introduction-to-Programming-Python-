Assignment 5 requires you to store a set of words as strings in a list. Once all words have been provided, you need to determine which word is the longest (if more than one word is of this length, any of the longest words will be correct) AND create a new word from the first letter of each string, in the order they were entered.

In the first sample output below, the program user will indicate they want to enter three words. They will then enter those 3 words - banana, apple, and grapes. The program will store these words as strings in a list called wordList. The program will identify the longest word (banana) and store it as a string in the variable longestWord. The program will also use the first letter from each word in the list to form a new word (bag) and store it in the variable firstLetters.
