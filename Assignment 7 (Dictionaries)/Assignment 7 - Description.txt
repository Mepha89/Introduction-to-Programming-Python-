In this assignment, you will use a dictionary called balances to track money balances for people (think of it as a very insecure banking interface). This dictionary will be a global variable in your script.

You will create two functions, depositMoney() and withdrawMoney(), that will be used to manipulate this dictionary to add or subtract money from a person's account. These functions will return a tuple of information. The functions you need to create are described in the function specifications below.

Function 1: depositMoney(name, amount)

"""

Given a person's name and amount of money, adds amount to their account.

If person does not have an account, one is created for them.

Parameters:

name - string

amount - float, amount >= 0

Returns: 

bool - True if account existed, False if account had to be created

float - new balance for person

"""


Function 2: withdrawMoney(name, amount)

"""

Given a person's name and amount of money, withdraws amount from their account.

If person does not have enough balance, function indicates overdraft

If person does not have an account, function indicates error

Parameters:

name - string

amount - float, amount >= 0

Returns: 

bool - True if account existed, False if not
